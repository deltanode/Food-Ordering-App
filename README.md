# Food-Ordering-App
A Swiggy-like video streaming app using React, Redux &amp; Tailwind CSS.

In this project I have used Swiggy live API to fetch all the data through CORS.
- React js as a UI library.
- Redux toolkit for state management.
- React router-V6 for routing.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Parcel for bundling.
- Completely responsive.
- React testing library for unit testing and integration testing.
